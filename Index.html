                        <span>Mi Reina</span>! I hope you remember me. Today holds a special place in my heart— it’s the
                        day the
                        world was graced with your presence. Your eyes were like windows to another world, a place where
                        golden sunsets melted into the horizon and the warmth of honeyed love lingered in the air. They
                        held the mystery of dark, ancient woods, pulling me in with the promise of secrets untold. In
                        their depths, I saw burning stars, shimmering with the mysteries of the universe, vast and
                        unexplored. They were as profound and captivating as the deepest ocean, making it impossible to
                        look away. And in that moment, <span>I fell, completely and irreversibly, into their endless
                            allure.</span>
                    </p>

                    <p class="p2">
                        If I were a poet, I would describe your eyes like this: <br>"<span>Eyes</span> like golden
                        skies, as if they
                        have
                        drowned the sun within them. <br><span>Eyes</span> that remind me of the sweetness of honey, the
                        amber warmth of
                        love. <br><span>Eyes</span> like dark woods, where one could be lost and never found.
                        <br><span>Eyes</span> like burning stars,
                        mysteries of the universe yet to be discovered. <br><span>Eyes</span> as profound and
                        captivating as the depths
                        of
                        the ocean. <br><span>Eyes</span> worth loving and dying for. <br><span>Eyes</span> like a starry
                        night carrying the secrets of the
                        universe. They say mysteries often make you lose your mind. <span>I have already lost
                            mine</span>."

                        Then, on our tour of Purulia, I had the chance to get to know you better, and I found myself
                        falling
                        even deeper for you. I never mentioned it, but it was in Purulia that everything began. During
                        our
                        trip to Puri, I finally confessed my feelings. The days after returning from Puri were some of
                        the
                        best of my life. Your bracelet still remains with me as a lucky charm, and I still keep your
                        photo.
                        I saw you a few days ago but didn’t have the courage to speak. However, due to some
                        misunderstandings, everything ended. I had thought of a wonderful gift for your birthday, but it
                        all
                        fell apart before I could give it to you. <span>I really, really miss you</span>, your family,
                        and your
                        sister
                        dearly. I will never forget you. If you ever want to talk to me, know that I will always wait
                        for
                        you. <span>I hope life treats you kindly</span> and you find <span>happiness</span> wherever you
                        are, even if I’m not
                        by
                        your side.
